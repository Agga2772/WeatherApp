Search by City: Users can input a city name to get the current weather details.

Use My Location: Allows users to fetch weather data for their current geographical location.

Dynamic Weather Icons: Displays weather-specific icons for better visualization.

Search History: Shows a list of recently searched cities for quick access.

Responsive Design: Ensures seamless usability across various devices and screen sizes.
